This may be limiting due to, for example, prohibitive expense of computer simulations or lack of field/experimental data. ML models have been mainly applied to tasks and domains that, while impactful, have sufficient volume of data. However, when deploying ML models for scientific or engineering tasks, they are sometimes invoked in conditions that do not overlap the set of scenarios for which the model was trained, or in scenarios with insufficient high-fidelity data for training purposes. State-of-the-art ML models, despite exhibiting superior performance on the domain they were trained on, suffer detrimental loss in performance in such extrapolatory or data-sparse settings. This loss in performance is also unpredictable and sensitive to both the amount and nature of data sparsity.\nTransfer learning is the process in which knowledge gained through similar training tasks is used to improve the training process on a new task, possibly suffering from limited data. Alternatively, data of lower levels of fidelity might improve the training task of interest by supplementing sparse high-fidelity data through multi-fidelity training frameworks. This mini-symposium will focus on novel methodologies and applications of transfer learning and multi-fidelity data fusion to enhance the performance of ML models in sparse data settings.\n","date":1654041600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654041600,"objectID":"a0e79167926964f7bf753041872f4dcb","permalink":"https://cosminsafta.github.io/news/2022-06-01/","publishdate":"2022-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2022-06-01/","section":"news","summary":"https://meetings.siam.org/program.cfm?CONFCODE=mds22","tags":["Academic"],"title":"Co-organizing minisymposium on \"Transfer Learning and Multi-Fidelity Approaches to Alleviate Data Sparsity in Machine Learning\" at SIAM-MDS22","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"I am contributing to the following presentations at this conference:\n Arun S.

In this article, we present a bifidelity approach to solve nonlinear inverse problems. In the bifidelity inversion method, the low-fidelity model is used to acquire a good initial guess, and the high-fidelity model is used to locate the global minimum. Combined with a multistart optimization scheme, the proposed approach significantly increases the possibility of finding the global minimum for nonlinear inverse problems with many local minima. The method is tested with two toy problems and then applied to an electromagnetic well-logging inverse problem, which is difficult to solve using traditional gradient-based methods.

For those fuels that deviate from this simple trend, the deviation is closely related to the peak rate of production of OH, HO2, CH2O, and CO2 formed during oxidation. We use these insights to show that an accurate correlation between simulated profiles of these species in a PFR and 1st-stage IDT can be developed using convolutional neural networks.

The method was used to generate numerical samples that are statistically consistent with an existing dataset construed as a realization from a non-Gaussian random vector. The manifold structure is learned using diffusion manifolds and the statistical sample generation is accomplished using a projected It√¥ stochastic differential equation. This probabilistic learning approach has been extended to polynomial chaos representation of databases on manifolds and to probabilistic nonconvex constrained optimization with a fixed budget of function evaluations. The methodology introduces an isotropic-diffusion kernel with hyperparameter Œµ. Currently, Œµ is more or less arbitrarily chosen. In this paper, we propose a selection criterion for identifying an optimal value of Œµ, based on a maximum entropy argument. The result is a comprehensive, closed, probabilistic model for characterizing data sets with hidden constraints. This entropy argument ensures that out of all possible models, this is the one that is the most uncertain beyond any specified constraints, which is selected.

A comprehensive statistical analysis, with a sufficiently large number of samples, remains elusive. Statistical learning is an approach that allows for extracting more information using fewer samples. Such procedures, if successful, will greatly enhance the predictability of models in the sense of improving exploration and characterization of uncertainty due to model error and input dependencies, all while being constrained by the size of the associated statistical samples. In this paper, it is shown how a recently developed procedure for probabilistic learning on manifolds can serve to improve the predictability in a probabilistic framework of a scramjet simulation. The estimates of the probability density functions of the quantities of interest are improved together with estimates of the statistics of their maxima.

However, training a surrogate model can be remarkably challenging and even computationally prohibitive in the case of intensive simulations and large-dimensional systems. We develop a systematic approach for surrogate model construction in reduced input parameter spaces. A sparse set of model evaluations in the original input space is used to approximate derivative based global sensitivity measures (DGSMs) for individual uncertain inputs of the model. An iterative screening procedure is developed that exploits DGSM estimates in order to identify the unimportant inputs. The screening procedure forms an integral part of an overall framework for adaptive construction of a surrogate in the reduced space. The framework is tested for computational efficiency through an initial implementation in simple test cases such as the classic Borehole function, and a semilinear elliptic PDE with a random source function. The framework is then deployed for a realistic application from chemical kinetics, where we study the ignition delay in an H2/O2 reaction mechanism with 19 and 33 uncertain rate-controlling parameters.

The approach is illustrated through the construction of a mixed scheme incorporating a stabilised second-order, Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev method and the CVODE stiff solver. The scheme is first applied to an idealised stiff reaction-diffusion problem that admits an analytical solution. Analysis of the computations reveals that as expected the scheme exhibits a second-order in time convergence, and that, compared to an operator-split construction, time integration errors are substantially reduced. The non-split scheme is then applied to model the transient evolution of a freely-propagating, 1D methane-air flame. A low-mach-number, detailed kinetics, combustion model, discretised in space using fourth-order differences, is used for this purpose. To assess the performance of the scheme, self-convergence tests are conducted, and the results are contrasted with computations performed using a Strang-split construction. Whereas both the split and non-split approaches exhibit second-order in time behaviour, it is seen that for the same value of the time step, the non-split approach exhibits significantly smaller time integration errors. On the other hand, the results also indicate that the application of the present non-split construction becomes attractive when large integration steps are used, due to numerical overhead.","tags":null,"title":"A hybrid, non-split, stiff/RKC, solver for advection‚Äìdiffusion‚Äìreaction equations and its application to low-Mach number combustion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

However, despite being theoretically solvable in polynomial time, SDP problems in practice are computationally challenging and quickly become intractable with increasing problem sizes.

Bayesian inference implemented by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling provides a comprehensive framework to estimate model parameters and associated uncertainties using their posterior distributions.

In this work, a differential evolution adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm is used to estimate posterior distributions of 21 parameters for the data assimilation linked ecosystem carbon (DALEC) model using 14 years of daily net ecosystem exchange data collected at the Harvard Forest Environmental Measurement Site eddy-flux tower. The calibration of DREAM results in a better model fit and predictive performance compared to the popular adaptive Metropolis (AM) scheme. Moreover, DREAM indicates that two parameters controlling autumn phenology have multiple modes in their posterior distributions while AM only identifies one mode. The application suggests that DREAM is very suitable to calibrate complex terrestrial ecosystem models, where the uncertain parameter size is usually large and existence of local optima is always a concern. In addition, this effort justifies the assumptions of the error model used in Bayesian calibration according to the residual analysis. The result indicates that a heteroscedastic, correlated, Gaussian error model is appropriate for the problem, and the consequent constructed likelihood function can alleviate the underestimation of parameter uncertainty that is usually caused by using uncorrelated error models.","tags":null,"title":"Bayesian calibration of terrestrial ecosystem models: a study of advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":["F.

The bounds have two contributions. First, the influence of boundary conditions is taken into account through a discrete maximum principle. Second, the contribution of the source field is evaluated in a fashion similar to that used in the treatment of the continuous a priori operators. Closed form expressions are, in particular, obtained for the case of a conservative, second-order finite difference approximation of the diffusion equation with variable scalar diffusivity. The bounds are then incorporated into a resilient domain decomposition framework, in order to verify the admissibility of local PDE solutions. The computations demonstrate that the bounds are able to detect most system faults, and thus considerably enhance the resilience and the overall performance of the solver.","tags":null,"title":"Discrete A Priori Bounds for the Detection of Corrupted PDE Solutions in Exascale Computations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

The strategy is based on a deterministic analysis and reduction method which employs computational singular perturbation analysis to generate simplified kinetic mechanisms, starting from a detailed reference mechanism. We model uncertain quantities in the reference mechanism, namely the Arrhenius rate parameters, as random variables with prescribed uncertainty factors. We propagate this uncertainty to obtain the probability of inclusion of each reaction in the simplified mechanism. We propose probabilistic error measures to compare predictions from the uncertain reference and simplified models, based on the comparison of the uncertain dynamics of the state variables, where the mixture entropy is chosen as progress variable. We employ the construction for the simplification of an uncertain mechanism in an n-butane‚Äìair mixture homogeneous ignition case, where a 176-species, 1111-reactions detailed kinetic model for the oxidation of n-butane is used with uncertainty factors assigned to each Arrhenius rate pre-exponential coefficient. This illustration is employed to highlight the utility of the construction, and the performance of a family of simplified models produced depending on chosen thresholds on importance and marginal probabilities of the reactions.","tags":null,"title":"Chemical model reduction under uncertainty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Accurate evaluations of expectations or higher order moments for quantities of interest, e.g., generating cost, can require a prohibitively large number of samples. We propose an alternative to Monte Carlo sampling based on polynomial chaos expansions. These representations enable efficient and accurate propagation of uncertainties in model parameters, using sparse quadrature methods. We also use Karhunen-Lo√®ve expansions for efficient representation of uncertain renewable energy generation that follows geographical and temporal correlations derived from historical data at each wind farm. Considering expected production cost, we demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield several orders of magnitude reduction in computational cost for solving stochastic economic dispatch relative to Monte Carlo sampling, for a given target error threshold.","tags":null,"title":"Efficient Uncertainty Quantification in Stochastic Economic Dispatch","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Available published data is summary statistics in terms of nominal values and error bars of the rate coefficient of this reaction at a number of temperature values obtained from shock-tube experiments. Our approach relies on generating data, in this case OH concentration profiles, consistent with the given summary statistics, using Approximate Bayesian Computation methods and a Markov chain Monte Carlo procedure. The approach permits the forward propagation of parametric uncertainty through the computational model in a manner that is consistent with the published statistics. A consensus joint posterior on the parameters is obtained by pooling the posterior parameter densities given each consistent data set. To expedite this process, we construct efficient surrogates for the OH concentration using a combination of Pad√© and polynomial approximants. These surrogate models adequately represent forward model observables and their dependence on input parameters and are computationally efficient to allow their use in the Bayesian inference procedure. We also utilize Gauss‚ÄìHermite quadrature with Gaussian proposal probability density functions for moment computation resulting in orders of magnitude speedup in data likelihood evaluation. Despite the strong non-linearity in the model, the consistent data sets all result in nearly Gaussian conditional parameter probability density functions. The technique also accounts for nuisance parameters in the form of Arrhenius parameters of other rate coefficients with prescribed uncertainty. The resulting pooled parameter probability density function is propagated through stoichiometric hydrogen‚Äìair auto-ignition computations to illustrate the need to account for correlation among the Arrhenius rate parameters of one reaction and across rate parameters of different reactions.","tags":null,"title":"Inference of reaction rate parameters based on summary statistics from experiments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

Given the recent tendencies in computer architecture development, one needs to reformulate legacy codes in order to cope with large amounts of communication, system faults, and requirements of low-memory usage per core.

Such reformulation allows resiliency with respect to potential faults without having to apply fault detection, avoids unnecessary communication, and is generally well-suited for rigorous uncertainty quantification studies that target improvements of predictive fidelity of scientific models.
