The approach uses timely epidemiological data that has been widely available for COVID-19. It provides short-term forecasts of the outbreak’s evolution, which can then be used for medical resource planning. The method postulates one- and multiwave infection models, which are convolved with the incubation-period distribution to yield competing disease models. The disease models’ parameters are estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and information-theoretic criteria are used to select between them for use in forecasting. The method is demonstrated on two- and three-wave COVID-19 outbreaks in California, New Mexico and Florida, as observed during Summer-Winter 2020. We find that the method is robust to noise, provides useful forecasts (along with uncertainty bounds) and that it reliably detected when the initial single-wave COVID-19 outbreaks transformed into successive surges as containment efforts in these states failed by the end of Spring 2020.","tags":null,"title":"Forecasting Multi-Wave Epidemics Through Bayesian Inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":["O.

We use a canonical problem in heterogeneous catalysis, the transient continuous stirred tank reactor (T-CSTR), for illustration. The T-CSTR problem is modelled fundamentally as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, but it can be transformed to a DAE system if one approximates typically fast surface processes using algebraic constraints for the surface species. We demonstrate the application of CSP analysis for both ODE and DAE constructions of a T-CSTR problem, illustrating the dynamical response of the system in each case. We also highlight the utility of the analysis in commenting on the quality of any particular DAE approximation built using the quasi-steady state approximation (QSSA), relative to the ODE reference case.","tags":null,"title":"Using computational singular perturbation as a diagnostic tool in ODE and DAE systems: a case study in heterogeneous catalysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.L.

Deep learning models, in particular variants of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been studied for ILI (Influenza-Like Illness) forecasting, and have achieved a higher forecasting skill compared to conventional models such as ARIMA. In this study, we adapt two neural networks that employ one-dimensional temporal convolutional layers as a primary building block—temporal convolutional networks and simple neural attentive meta-learners—for epidemiological forecasting. We then test them with influenza data from the US collected over 2010-2019. We find that epidemiological forecasting with CNNs is feasible, and their forecasting skill is comparable to, and at times, superior to, plain RNNs. Thus CNNs and RNNs bring the power of nonlinear transformations to purely data-driven epidemiological models, a capability that heretofore has been limited to more elaborate mechanistic/compartmental disease models.","tags":null,"title":"The predictive skill of convolutional neural networks models for disease forecasting","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cosmin Safta"],"categories":["white paper"],"content":"","date":1617235200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1617235200,"objectID":"f8dfa4f1d73f765e42a6748e570d22be","permalink":"https://cosminsafta.github.io/post/2021-04/","publishdate":"2021-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-04/","section":"post","summary":"White papers were solicited for development and application of AI methods in areas relevant to EESSD research with an emphasis on quantifying and improving Earth system predictability, particularly related to the integrative water cycle and extreme events.

Sampling-based methods require a large number of model evaluations; gradient-based methods require fewer model evaluations but only find the local minima. Multifidelity optimization combines the low-fidelity model and the high-fidelity model to achieve both high accuracy and high efficiency. In this article, we present a bifidelity approach to solve nonlinear inverse problems. In the bifidelity inversion method, the low-fidelity model is used to acquire a good initial guess, and the high-fidelity model is used to locate the global minimum. Combined with a multistart optimization scheme, the proposed approach significantly increases the possibility of finding the global minimum for nonlinear inverse problems with many local minima. The method is tested with two toy problems and then applied to an electromagnetic well-logging inverse problem, which is difficult to solve using traditional gradient-based methods. The bifidelity method provides promising inversion results and can be easily applied to traditional gradient-based methods.","tags":null,"title":"Bifidelity Gradient-Based Approach for Nonlinear Well-Logging Inverse Problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.J.

We find that for many fuels the timescale for the onset of spontaneous oxidation in dilute fuel/air mixtures in a simple PFR is similar to the 1st-stage ignition delay time (IDT) at stoichiometric engine-relevant conditions. For those fuels that deviate from this simple trend, the deviation is closely related to the peak rate of production of OH, HO2, CH2O, and CO2 formed during oxidation. We use these insights to show that an accurate correlation between simulated profiles of these species in a PFR and 1st-stage IDT can be developed using convolutional neural networks. Our simulations suggest that the accuracy of such a correlation is 10–50%, which is appropriate for rapid fuel screening and may be sufficient for predictive fuel performance modeling.","tags":null,"title":"Simulated production of OH, HO2, CH2O, and CO2 during dilute fuel oxidation can predict 1st-stage ignition delays","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.G.

The method was used to generate numerical samples that are statistically consistent with an existing dataset construed as a realization from a non-Gaussian random vector. The manifold structure is learned using diffusion manifolds and the statistical sample generation is accomplished using a projected Itô stochastic differential equation. This probabilistic learning approach has been extended to polynomial chaos representation of databases on manifolds and to probabilistic nonconvex constrained optimization with a fixed budget of function evaluations. The methodology introduces an isotropic-diffusion kernel with hyperparameter ε. Currently, ε is more or less arbitrarily chosen. In this paper, we propose a selection criterion for identifying an optimal value of ε, based on a maximum entropy argument. The result is a comprehensive, closed, probabilistic model for characterizing data sets with hidden constraints. This entropy argument ensures that out of all possible models, this is the one that is the most uncertain beyond any specified constraints, which is selected.

The approach is illustrated through the construction of a mixed scheme incorporating a stabilised second-order, Runge-Kutta-Chebyshev method and the CVODE stiff solver. The scheme is first applied to an idealised stiff reaction-diffusion problem that admits an analytical solution. Analysis of the computations reveals that as expected the scheme exhibits a second-order in time convergence, and that, compared to an operator-split construction, time integration errors are substantially reduced. The non-split scheme is then applied to model the transient evolution of a freely-propagating, 1D methane-air flame. A low-mach-number, detailed kinetics, combustion model, discretised in space using fourth-order differences, is used for this purpose. To assess the performance of the scheme, self-convergence tests are conducted, and the results are contrasted with computations performed using a Strang-split construction. Whereas both the split and non-split approaches exhibit second-order in time behaviour, it is seen that for the same value of the time step, the non-split approach exhibits significantly smaller time integration errors. On the other hand, the results also indicate that the application of the present non-split construction becomes attractive when large integration steps are used, due to numerical overhead.","tags":null,"title":"A hybrid, non-split, stiff/RKC, solver for advection–diffusion–reaction equations and its application to low-Mach number combustion","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
